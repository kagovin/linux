I will compile the list of servers by separate applications (database, middleware & upstream) and server type (prod & non-prod).
Also will breakdown the server list according to planned date. Then,
Will inform the respective server owners about the criticality of this issue and get server downtime from them.
Once donwtime is provided by server owners then I will submit change ticket accordingly base on the scheduled date. And,
Get the change ticket fully approved before the planned start date.
Snapshot will be taken before the change planned start date.
I will start execute the plan provided by vendor to fix the vulnerability.
Once completed will inform the respective server owner to verify and provide the AVP.
Once AVP provided, will proceed to close the change ticket.
After 2-3 working days, will start to remove the snapshots.
