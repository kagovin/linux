If its a Red Hat machine has high CPU usage, Need to run Top command to find out the CPU usage.
Find out who is monopolizing or eating the CPU and engaged the right team (Could be Application/ DB or backup) engage the respective team to reslove this issue.

If this issues persist,Use the nice command to manually lower the task's priority. Use the cpulimit command to repeatedly pause the process so that it doesn't exceed 
a certain limit. Use Linux's built-in control groups, a mechanism which tells the scheduler to limit the amount of resources available to the process.

If the issue is not resolving further, Then we can engaged with Redhat for solutions as well.

Beside this, we can also tune the I/O performance.
Test the disk speed and enable direct memory access (DMA).
DMA is not enabled by default, the transfer rate might have improved considerably.
